## BIO
<img src="http://magenta-note-1305707521.coscd.myqcloud.com/JiangHan.jpg" align='right' alt="JiangHan" style="zoom:15%; padding:100px"/> I am currently an undergraduate student in the [College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn) at [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn), major in **Software Engineering**.

I am currently developing in Go language and related tools, whose pros are considered as flexibility, efficiency, versatility, and power. A growing community gives such great language soil to grow, I am also determined to contribute to it.

My research interests mainly focus on the use of practical applications related to Golang, i.e. Docker, Kubernetes, Trojan, as well as cloud computing infrastructure and architecture, which give a higher speed and better service whith lower cost and delay.

I am learning Rust-lang too! A deeper understanding of non-script language will be of great benefit to not only my following graduate stage, but also my personal development and contributions to open-source projects.
