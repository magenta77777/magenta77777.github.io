## BIO
<img src="http://magenta-note-1305707521.coscd.myqcloud.com/JiangHan.jpg" align='right' alt="JiangHan" style="zoom:15%; padding:150px"/> I am currently an undergraduate student major in **Software Engineering** at the [College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn), [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn), China.

I mainly develop in Go language and related tools, whose pros are considered as flexibility, efficiency, availability, and high performance in concurrent programming, with nearly few cons. A growing community gives such great language soil to grow, I am also determined to contribute to it.

My research interests mainly focus on the use of practical applications related to Golang, i.e. Docker, Kubernetes, Trojan, as well as cloud computing infrastructure and architecture, which give a higher speed and better service whith lower cost and delay.

I am learning Rust-lang too! A deeper understanding of C-like language will be of great benefit to not only my following graduate stage, but also my personal development and contributions to open-source projects.
